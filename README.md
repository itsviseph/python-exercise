# Python Exercises 🐍

This repository contains small Python exercises that I am working on while learning Python fundamentals.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice core Python concepts
- Build consistency through daily coding
- Track my learning progress over time

Each file focuses on **one concept or problem**, keeping things simple and readable.
